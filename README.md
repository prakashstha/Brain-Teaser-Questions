# Brain-Teaser-Questions
Collection of crazy brain-teaser interview questions.

1.**Bullets in Revolver** A Russian gangster kidnaps you. He puts two bullets in consecutive order in an empty six-round revolver, spins it, points it at your head and shoots. *click* You’re still alive. He then asks you, “do you want me to spin it again and fire or pull the trigger again right away?” For each option, what is the probability that you’ll be shot?

2. **Probability of Raining:** You’re about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if it’s raining. You call 3 random friends who live there and ask each if it’s raining. Each friend has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying. All 3 friends tell you that “Yes” it is raining. What is the probability that it’s actually raining in Seattle? 

3. **Jugs of Water:** You have a 3 gallon jug and 5 gallon jug, how do you measure out exactly 4 gallons? 

4. **Correct the Labels in Boxes** There are three boxes, one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. The boxes have been incorrectly labeled such that no label identifies the actual contents of its box. Opening just one box, and without looking in the box, you take out one piece of fruit. By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly? 

5. **Coin Piles**: You have a 100 coins laying flat on a table, each with a head side and a tail side. 10 of them are heads up, 90 are tails up. You can’t feel, see or in any other way find out which 10 are heads up. Your goal: split the coins into two piles so there are the same number of heads-up coins in each pile. 

6. **Three Switches**: You’re in a room with three light switches, each of which controls one of three light bulbs in the next room. You need to determine which switch controls which bulb. All lights are off to begin, and you can’t see into one room from the other. You can inspect the other room only once. How can you find out which switches are connected to which bulbs? 

7. **Frog Leap:** A frog is at the bottom of a 30 meter well. Each day he summons enough energy for one 3 meter leap up the well. Exhausted, he then hangs there for the rest of the day. At night, while he is asleep, he slips 2 meters backwards. How many days does it take him to escape from the well?

8. **Heavier Ball I:** Suppose you had eight identical balls. One of them is slightly heavier and you are given a balance scale . What's the fewest number of times you have to use the scale to find the heavier ball?

9. **Heavier Ball II** GIven 9 balls all of which weigh the same except for one, what is the minimum of weighings necessary to find the ball weighs more (or less).

10. **Rank the Horses** You have 15 horses that run various speeds. You own a race track on which you can race the horses, and this track holds a maximum of 5 horses per race. If you have no stopwatch or other means of telling exactly how fast the horses are, how many races would you need to run between the horses to be ABSOLUTELY SURE which horses are first, second, and third fastest?

11. **Sum of Digits:** What is the sum of the digits of all the numbers from 1 to 1000000? This is different from the sum of the numbers. For instance the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is 55 whereas the sum of the digits is 46.

12. **Square Root:** What is the square root of 0.1? ==> 0.3167

13. **Trailing Zeros:** How many trailing zeros are in the number 23! (5 factorial), 101!, 1000!?

14. **The Heavy Pills:** You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provide an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle?

15. **Basketball:** You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play of of two games. 
  - Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop
  - Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots. 
  If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick on game or the other?

16. **Dominos:** There is an 8 x 8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corner's (having same color) have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a signle domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible)

17. **Ants in Triangle:** There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed. Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

18. **The Apocalypse:** In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately concerned about the birth rate. Therefore, she decrees that all families should ensure that they have one girl or else they face massive fines. If all families abide by this policy-that is, they have continue to have children until they have one girl, at which point they immediately stop-what will the gender ratio of the new generation be? (Assume that the odds of someone having a boy or a girl on any given pregnancy is equal.) Solve this out logically and then write a computer simulation of it.

19. **Blue-Eyed Island:** A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00 pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else’s eye color, but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

20. **The Egg Drop Problem:** There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it’s dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You’re given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.
6.9 100 Lockers: There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all 100 lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third locker (closes it if it is open or opens it if it is closed). This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass i, the man toggles every ith locker. After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker #100, how many lockers are open?
21. **Poison:** You have 1000 bottles of soda, and exactly one is poisoned. You have 10 test strips which can be used to detect poison. A single drop of poison will turn the test strip positive permanently. You can put any number of drops on a test strip at once and you can reuse a test strip as many times as you’d like (as long as the results are negative). However, you can only run tests once per day and it takes seven days to return a result. How would you figure out the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible?
